# TodoApp(MVVM1)(ViewandModel)

We will kick-off the app by creating the main screens! In this project focused on SwiftUI logic to build out the views where users can manage the Todo List and add new items. In MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel architecture), the View layer is strictly responsible for the UI (user interface) of the application
I created the Model layer! In MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, the Model layer manages logic for specific pieces of data in your app. In our Todo List, we  created a Model that will hold all information relating to a single item on the list.
